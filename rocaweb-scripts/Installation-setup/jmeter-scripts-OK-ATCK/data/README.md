# IMPORTANT
* **All of the data contained in the CSV files is fake. It was randomly generated by Mockaroo, which is a web application specialized in providing random data-sets.**
* **Therefore all emails, passwords, names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card credentials, etc... are fake and cannot be used in real world applications.**
**They are only meant to be used to mimic virtual clients when testing a web application and a firewall.**
* More specifically, all **credit card credentials** were randomly generated. For each fake credit card, the credit card number, expiration month, expiration year and CVV were independently generated by Mockaroo:
    * credit card number - used the *credit card number* element in Mockaroo
    * expiration month - random number between 1 and 12
    * expiration year - random number between 2018 and 2030
    * CVV - random number between 1 and 999
