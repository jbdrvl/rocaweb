# JMeter Installation Scripts

These scripts are meant to be used along the RoCaWeb Userguide written by Jean-Baptiste DURVILLE over the Summer 2017. 

[RoCaWeb](https://github.com/dakountche/RoCaWeb) is a *smart firewall* that uses **machine learning** to protect web applications.

## **IMPORTANT**

The user credentials used in these scripts are all **fake**, and cannot be used anywhere else. There were randomly generated for these scripts.
