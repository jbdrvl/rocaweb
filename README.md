# RoCaWeb
Test files for the installation and testing of the RoCaWeb firewall.

These are old scripts from the Summer 2017 and really need to be reviewed. I plan on doing this once we have a more stable version of [RoCaWeb](https://github.com/dakountche/RoCaWeb).

## rocaweb-scripts/ Directory
This folder aims at providing the user with the necessary scripts to test RoCaWeb with Hackazon. 
The main files right under **rocaweb-scripts/** are **launch.sh** and **algo_list.txt**. **algo_list.txt** should contain the list of the algorithms to be used by the RoCaWeb WebUI when producing the ModSecurity rules; the list of all available algorithms is available in the **README.md** file.
The **launch.sh** script is described in the **README.md** file as well.
